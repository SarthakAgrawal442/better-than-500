## 🎯 Key Calculations

### Stock/ETF Returns

- **Future Value** = Principal × (1 + rate)^years + Monthly contributions with compound growth
- **Effective Return** = Annual return - Annual fees
- **Comparison** = Your investment vs S&P 500 (7% historical average)

### Real Estate vs Rent + Invest

- **Real Estate Path** = Property equity (appreciation + mortgage paydown)
- **Rent + Invest Path** = S&P 500 returns on (down payment + monthly cost difference)
- **Monthly Difference** = Total ownership costs - Comparable rent
- **Winner** = Higher final value after holding period
